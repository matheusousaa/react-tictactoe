<h1>The ideia of this project is to follow the guide from React Documentation to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game</h1>

<h3>This project consists in:</h3>
<li>Lets you play tic-tac-toe;</li>
<li>Indicates when a player has won the game;</li>
<li>Stores a game’s history as a game progresses;</li>
<li>Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board;</li>

<h3>The following features were implemented</h3>
<li>For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.</li>
<li>Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.</li>
<li>Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.</li>
<li>When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).</li>
<li>Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.</li>
